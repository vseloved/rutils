ITER -- ITERATE with KEYWORDS
-----------------------------

Idea: provide the possibility to use the powerful ITERATE macro
without the need to import (and effectively lock) around 40 quite
common names, some of which conflict with the CL-USER
package. Besides, simplify, regularize and document the code base, so
that it could be easily supported and further extended (at least one
bug was found during this process).


Improvements and changes to original ITERATE:

* used and improved Denis Budyak's support for keywords from the
  KEYWORD (and not ITERATE) package

* added additional keywords, which can't be duplicated as symbols from
  ITERATE package due to CL-USER lock :search :reduce :adjoin,
  :append, :nconc, :union, :nunion

* removed ITERATE entry-point (and left only ITER) to distinguish (to
  some extent) from original ITERATE without keyword support

* documented

* simplified bindings and conditional evaluation: used bind,
  when/unless, cond where appropriate, removed #L

* in WALK added symbol-macros' processing

* bug fixes:
  - removed ' before ,RESULT-TYPE in RETURN-COLLECTION-CODE, so that
    non-constant RESULT-TYPEs could be passed to :INTO clause
